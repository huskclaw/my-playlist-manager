# My Playlist Manager

`This is a simple project to help me manage my private playlist`

`This program will help manage the playlist queue order by adding sequence number in the song filename, such as 001 Song-name.mp3. This program allow user to easily pick what song they want to include in the playlist, changing the song order, and shuffling the playlist based on song series and weight (4-1, 4 is favourite). The new playlist setting can be applied to current opened song directory or create a new playlist directory and copy the song to that new directory.`
